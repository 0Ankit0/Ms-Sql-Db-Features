                "Set operators in SQL Server allow you to combine the results of two or more `SELECT` queries. They treat the result sets as mathematical sets, where operations like union, intersection, or difference can be performed. The main set operators in SQL Server are `UNION`, `UNION ALL`, `INTERSECT`, and `EXCEPT`. Each of these operators requires the queries involved to return the same number of columns with compatible data types.\n",

Choosing the right operator depends on your specific requirements, such as whether you need to remove duplicates, find common data, or highlight differences between two data sets. Proper use of these operators, combined with indexing and careful query design, can significantly improve query performance and clarity in SQL operations."
